# A simple Trivia Game 

Goals - To make a simple trivia game with True/False answers. Retrive questions from an API endpoint. Project is to demonstrate:

  1. Use of API
    * Simple error handling.
    * Correct formating of given data. 
    * Mutating this data, adding another field per record.

  2. Modularity of react components
      * Button
      * Header
      * Card

  3. Modularity of utilty functions?
      * Regex parser

## Todos stuff to work on complete. Used to show logic of construction. 

- [x] API working, simply get 10 questions.
- [ ] Format data correctly /Regex 
- [x] State for user response / percentage of questions asked
- [ ] Feedback to user on questions correct / incorrect, perhaps an overlay with a big :x: or :+1 checkmark :white_check_mark:?
- [ ] Results screen
- [ ] - Summery of total questions asked. 
- [ ] reset game

</br>

## Summery of project: 
Not happy with being able to use react dev tools and view the state / answers. Would correct this with the server side and make these another endpoint in a real world situation.
