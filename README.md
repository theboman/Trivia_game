Goals - make a simple 10 question True/False game. Get questions from an API endpoint. The project is to demonstrate. 
  1. Use of API
  2. Modularity of react components
      * button
      * header
      * card

  3. Modularity of utilty functions?
      * regex parser

## Todos stuff to work on complete. Used to show logic of construction. 

- [ ] API working, simply get 10 questions.
- [ ] Format data correctly /Regex 
- [ ] State for user response / percentage of questions asked
- [ ] Feedback to user on questions correct / incorrect
- [ ] Results screen
- [ ] Summery of total questions asked. 

</br>

## Summery of project: 
Not happy with being able to use react dev tools and view the state / answers. Would correct this with the server side and make these another endpoint in a real world situation.
